Hi, my name is Rob Halff and I'm a Freelance Web Developer from [the Netherlands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands) who's main focus is creating software using all things javascript, both frontend and backend.

I enjoy facing new challenges as well as implementing the best well known solutions for common problems.

I have many years of experience throughout the whole internet spectrum, am a continuous learner and always strive to keep myself up to date on the latest technologies.

As said, my main expertise is writing web applications in [TypeScript][] and [Javascript][].

Regarding frontend frameworks I mostly use:

* [Angular](https://angular.io)
* [React](https://reactjs.org)

Recently, I am also developing in [Dart](https://dart.dev) and [Flutter](https://flutter.dev).
which for me is an exiting new environment.<br/>
If your company is seeking Flutter/Dart developers,
please do not hesitate to contact me!

My Dart/Flutter open source projects can be found at the github [dartlib][] organization.

Some recent work includes:

* [Validations][]<br/>
  A validation library using annotations.
* [Show(Case)](https://github.com/dartlib/show)<br/>
  Showcase your flutter widgets à la [storybooks][].
  
My main github profile can be found at https://github.com/rhalff

I'm mostly known as **rhalff** on any social or communication platform.
