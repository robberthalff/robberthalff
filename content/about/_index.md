I am a Freelance Web Developer from [the Netherlands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands).

My main expertise is writing web applications in [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org) and [Javascript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript).

Regarding frontend frameworks I mostly use:

* [Angular](https://angular.io)
* [React](https://reactjs.org)

I am also developing in [Dart](https://dart.dev) and [Flutter](https://flutter.dev).

I find it hard to define what I do in concrete terms.

As development in general is very versatile and each project is different
with it's own special requirements.

Thanks for reading!
